### Required Software

The articles on this website will stay tool-agnostic and will instead present concepts that can be found in all reputable tools. 
For details specific to a particular tool, refer to the tutorials mentioned below.

- **2D Art:** These may be image manipulation programs ([GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)) or graphics editors ([Krita](https://krita.org/en/), [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)).
- **3D Art:** These are tools that create 3D geometry and animations. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a popular tool that does almost everything you can imagine.
- **Game Engine:** Once your art content is done, you import it into a game engine and assemble a game. The engine provides tools and libraries for programming your game's logic. [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), [Unity](https://store.unity.com/download-nuo) and [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/) are popular choices.
- **Text Editor:** In most cases, the game engine will simply _read_ your code rather than allowing you to edit it. For actually writing the code, you'll need a text editor. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good cross-platform choice. Please don't use notepad.

The examples given above are all free. Commercial alternatives do exist but are not strictly necessary for our purposes.

#### Choosing the Right Engine

We will be using Unity for demonstrations during live workshops, because Unity is easy to pick up and runs reasonably well on 
most hardware. Unreal has a steeper learning curve and intense hardware requirements but it has a much larger library of 
high-quality free content on its marketplace that you can use to create impressive games fairly quickly. Godot is the simplest of 
the three and is a great option if you need a lightweight engine.

### Tutorials

As mentioned above, each skill would have a high-level overview of the concept, but for software-specific details we will 
attach some tutorials. The ones given below go over the creation of a complete project and can therefore act as a good reference 
for a variety of different concepts.

While the above tutorials are great to get started, you will often find yourself in a situation where you just need to quickly 
read more about a particular topic. Use each tool's official documentation for that. Finally, both Unreal and Unity have 
complete courses and samples on their website that you can refer to in the future.
